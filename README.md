# Using-time-series-analysis-to-forecast-American-Airlines-Group-stocks

The project involves using time series analysis to forecast American Airlines Group stocks. Key steps in the project include:

Visualizing the time series
Stationarity and white noise tests, as well as outlier detection
Box-Cox transformation to normalize the data
Residual analysis and model selection (ARIMA, SARIMA)
Predicting the time series using the selected models.
To accomplish this, we will be using libraries such as caschrono, forecast, BatchGetSymbols, ggplot2, and tsm.
